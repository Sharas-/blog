##discipline for the KISS

Keep it simple, stupid (KISS). Do the simplest thing that can possibly work. You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI). Deliver tangible value to users with each iteration. Keep that velocity wheel spinnig, take no hostidges. Inspiring isn't it? You can see a tingle in every team members' eyes. Yours is particularly bright. Except for Cornelius. He's not even facing your manager. Not that it matters, after pep talk she just delivered she's facing nobody, looking into the horizon with a stern determined gaze. Does he know something you don't?
