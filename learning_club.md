##IT Craftsmen Learning club

Learning is what makes us craftsmen. I want to intensify that already rewarding exercise. First, by energizing the activity of learning, and second, by reinforcing the knowledge and skills that we acquired. Learning with a group of like minded passionated craftsmen fulfils first objective. Presenting and explaining your newly acquired knowledge to the group takes care of the second.

None of us lack motivation to learn. That energy comes from inside - passion for our craft. And it adds-up. Prospect of sharing that passion with like minded peers works magic on concentrating and energizing your mind. 

When you study a subject and know people that are eager to learn it too, you become focused and alert in search for gems of knowledge to share with them: An insightful sentence you have just read in a book. An exemplary peace of code you spotted. An innovative technology you heard about. A blog post explaining intricacies of a useful technique. Just to mention few examples. 

#Facilitating sharing: knowledge chests

Every time you discover a finding, post it to a subject matter knowledge chest. Knowledge chest is a stream of concentrated subject matter intelligence assembled by you and your fellow craftsmen. It defines a context around which we bind into groups of researchers.
