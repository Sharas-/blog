#IT Craftsmen Learning club

Learning is what makes us craftsmen. I want to intensify that already rewarding exercise. First, by energizing the activity of learning, and second, by reinforcing the knowledge and skills that we acquired. Learning with a team of passionated researchers atcheves first objective. Presenting and explaining your newly acquired knowledge to fellow craftsmen takes care of the second. This is the purpose of IT Craftsmen Learning Club. 

We will meet periodicly in our club. Besides participating in debates, there are two ways you can contribute to our meetings:
- Introduce research topic you are about to embark upon and team-up with craftsmen inspired by your topic into research groups.
- Present findings along with the team of your ongoing research so far.

##Team learning

None of us lack motivation to learn. That energy comes from inside, fueled by passion for our craft. And it adds-up when you learn in a team. Prospect of sharing your discoveries with like minded peers works magic on concentrating and energizing your mind. When you study a subject and know people that are eager to learn it too, you become focused and alert in search for gems of knowledge to share with them. 

Research subjects are abound in our craft: A programming language you want to master, an innovative technology you want to explore, research paper you want to grasp, a book you are about to read... Just to mention few examples.

An insightful sentence you have just read in a book. An exemplary peace of code you spotted. An innovative technology you heard about. Research paper Just to mention few examples. 

##Facilitating sharing: knowledge chests

Every time you discover a finding, post it to a subject matter knowledge chest. Knowledge chest is a stream of concentrated subject matter intelligence assembled by you and your fellow craftsmen. It defines a context around which we bind into groups of researchers.
